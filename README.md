# Raspberry Pi 5 Projects

Welcome to this repository!  
Here you will find various projects developed and executed on the **Raspberry Pi 5**, using the programming languages **C** and **Python**.

## Contents

- 📂 Various embedded system projects
- 🔧 Development of low-level software in **C**
- 🐍 Rapid prototyping and automation with **Python**
- 🔌 Direct interaction with hardware components (sensors, actuators)
- 🌐 Networking and communication projects

## About Embedded Systems

**Embedded systems** are specialized computing systems that perform dedicated functions as part of larger mechanical or electrical systems. Key characteristics include:

- Resource constraints (limited memory and CPU power)
- Real-time capabilities
- Direct hardware control
- Focus on energy efficiency and reliability

The **Raspberry Pi 5** is an excellent platform for embedded projects because it:

- Provides powerful hardware,
- Offers versatile interfaces (GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART),
- And supports both prototyping and near-production-level solutions.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:**
  - C (for low-level, high-performance applications)
  - Python (for quick development and automation)
  
- **Platform:**
  - Raspberry Pi OS (Linux-based)
  
- **Typical Hardware:**
  - Sensors (e.g., temperature, distance, light)
  - Actuators (e.g., motors, LEDs, displays)
  - Communication modules (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa)
